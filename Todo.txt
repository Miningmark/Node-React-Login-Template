Frontend:
    - SettingPage mit Dark/Light mode

Backend:
    UserManagement:
        wenn admin deactivates/disables account access und refreshtoken l√∂schen

    SuperAdmin:
        should an SuperAdmin have permissions ? its possible to check after accessToken if isSuperAdmin and skip complete Permission checking
        adding isSuperAdmin to every response, to use in frontend?
        add isSuperAdmin to JWT Tokens for easier reading on backend
        make it impossible to edit/delete or create SuperAdmin

    Permissions Model:
        should change Permission <-> RouteGroup relations too many to many relation ??
        whould make some things like a Permission for SuperAdmin easier, or stick with permission skiping on backend??

    Language:
        check which options are available to define multiple languages and getting rid of duplicate error messages

    User Settings:
        creating new Model which is in relation to one User which holds data from Frontend for settings page, like dark/light mode, some preferences for later

    Renaming:
        rename folder structure to backend instead of server and client to frontend for a more clear naming
